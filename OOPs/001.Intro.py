#OOPs - Object Oriented Programming 
# A different style of writing code


# Everything is a object. ---> Variable 

myList = [12,34,56,7,89]
print(type(myList))
#<class 'list'>
# Class is blueprint ---> It is not a real life thing --> Car Blueprint
# We write more codes for Class 
# Object is an instance of class --> Using car Blueprint -> The manufacturer creates all the cars

myList.append(20)
#'list' object has no attribute 'add'
myTouple = (23,46)
